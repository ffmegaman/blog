In the summer of 2013, I started to question the value of my MBA. I mean, what can I DO with it? What can I BUILD with it? To correct this situation, I decided to take a deep dive into the world of computer programming.

I started with Codecademy. More specifically I took their python course, and well I managed to get about 3/4 of the way through, I couldn’t understand how I could BUILD anything with it.

``` ruby
cool_variable = cool_stuff
cool_variable
# => cool_stuff
```

That’s about all I learned on the Python course in Codecademy.  So I stopped. I realized I wasted my time.

Then in September, I saw an ad on Facebook called “Onemonthrails.” I clicked on it (the only Facebook ad I ever clicked on purpose) and the next thing I knew, I paid $40 (now it’s about $100) to get access into an online video course that promised to make me a web app developer in one month! Well they lied. I made a web app in 1 and a half weeks! I blazed through the course every night without fail (all while doing my MBA classes during the day). Before I knew it, I was hooked.

After finishing Onemonthrails, I spent the next month or two trying to develop a web app similar to Eventbrite. That’s when I realized that I have a lot to learn still. Countless times was I frustrated at mistakes I made and I would spend hours searching for the issue. I also realized another BIG problem. While I understood how to make the app at a 30,000 feet level, I didn’t understand it at a lower level, say 10,000 feet or 1,000 feet. I mean, just how exactly does the Model, View, and Controller work together? Why is it that when I type “rails generate scaffold Somethingcool” that all of a sudden all these files appeared in my app directory? I realized I needed to learn more about Rails.

Enter January 2014, I was busy preparing for my finals in the weeks coming, and I had just received an internship for a startup in Kobe, Japan. That’s also when I decided to get a copy of Michael Hartl’s Ruby on Rails Tutorial. It’s been two weeks since, and I have been steadily going through it. Managed to get about 3/4 of the way through the book so far and all I can say is that this book is truly gold for aspiring web developers. It has also cemented my desires for more Rails.
