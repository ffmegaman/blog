One of my close friend recently started a two week internship in Osaka. Her day to day responsibilities? Clean desks and make coffee. Hardly productive and educational for students. However she was one of the lucky ones, why? Because most Japanese companies do not know what an internship is, and if they do have an internship program, it is for two to three days.

Two weeks ago, an ACCJ (American Chambers of Commerce in Japan) held a conference in Osaka discussing the necessities for Japanese companies to implement western style internships. The reality is that Japanese companies hardly offer internships and this is tied to their corporate culture being a limiting factor. The sempai-kohai (senior-junior) relationship of work style is the ultimate culprit. If you hire an intern, where do you put the intern into the sempai-kohai hierarchy?

When Japanese graduate from university and enter their respective companies, they are placed in their first year class. This first year class usually involves working in the manufacturing floor (if a manufacturing company) or going to customers’ houses and greeting them (if a service company). As they age each year, the class of employees would go up one level (for example, moving from the manufacturing floor to the the copy room). See the problem?

If you stick an intern into a meaningful position like assisting the marketing department, he/she just skipped the first or second year of his/her class. So is this intern a sempai or a kohai to those who are in their first or two years of employment? Who are this intern’s equals? That one intern would have completely messed up the entire societal norms in the company.

In recent years some companies started to offer “internships.” However, these companies are using it unproductively as a way for students to observe the company. Most “internships” would last two to three days, and students are given a tour and explanation about some of the work being done in a specific office.

So implementing a full fledge internship program in Japan would require a complete overhaul of the recruiting system and overhaul of the sempai-kohai relationship system prevalent in the corporate culture here. That’s a big task, and not one that will happen soon.
