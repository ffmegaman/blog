  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/04/26/moved-to-octopress/">Moved to Octopress on Dokku!</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>So I have moved away from Wordpress and now on the hacker-friendly Octopress running on the mini-Heroku, Dokku. I also changed host from Godaddy to DigitalOcean, and there is definitely a speed increase with their SSDs.</p>




<p>Immediately, I experienced an issue on my first push of Octopress to Dokku. When I tried to view the blog on my browser, I recieved a Nginx gateway error. That was easily fixed however by ensuring that <code>gem 'thin'</code> is in the gemfile. After that, I just ran bundle install, git commit, and pushed it up to dokku and all was fine.</p>




<p>Here is what my gemfile looks like now</p>

<p>Awesome. I am really liking Octopress. Time to migrate my old posts here.</p>

    <p>In mid February, I took on a project to develop a web portal for the company I was interning at, Asterism Healthcare Plus. This would be my first work on a real project rather than tutorial projects, I did warn them of course, but due to budget constraint they let me work on it. I was paired up with another guy, Laurent Safa, who wasn’t part of Asterism, but was paid to consult and manage the database for Asterism. Unlike me, Laurent was well experienced in web development, and being paired up with him meant that I would learn a ton.</p>

  <p>
    <p>In the summer of 2013, I started to question the value of my MBA. I mean, what can I DO with it? What can I BUILD with it? To correct this situation, I decided to take a deep dive into the world of computer programming.</p>




<p>I started with Codecademy. More specifically I took their python course, and well I managed to get about &frac34; of the way through, I couldn’t understand how I could BUILD anything with it.</p>


<p><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="n">cool_variable</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; cool_stuff</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>That’s about all I learned on the Python course in Codecademy.  So I stopped. I realized I wasted my time.</p>




<p>Then in September, I saw an ad on Facebook called “Onemonthrails.” I clicked on it (the only Facebook ad I ever clicked on purpose) and the next thing I knew, I paid $40 (now it’s about $100) to get access into an online video course that promised to make me a web app developer in one month! Well they lied. I made a web app in 1 and a half weeks! I blazed through the course every night without fail (all while doing my MBA classes during the day). Before I knew it, I was hooked.</p>

    <p><img class="left" src="/images/knowledge-salon.jpg" title="Working in Knowledge Salon" ></p>




<p>What a small world. A few days ago I had lunch with Arthur Matsumoto, former SVP of Panasonic America and now part of an angel group with extensive connections in Hong Kong. I intended to ask him more about the startups that he is working with. Little did I know that he is also involved with the creation of Knowledge Capital, the organization that is running the Knowledge Salon, a large co-working and incubation space in the new Grand Front Osaka complex. Which so happens that I have a membership myself and often go there.</p>

  <p>
    <p>One thing that I really miss about home is the ability to stand next to a stranger and say “Hi, how are you?” and start a conversation. You cannot find that here in Japan. Standing next to a stranger in Japan and saying “Genki desuka?” (equivalent of how are you) is just socially awkward. Of course it’s not all that bad, sometimes it’s really nice to commute on the train or bus in absolute silence. Imagine a packed train in Osaka with everyone speaking at once. if you are part of the conversation than that would be fun, but if you are trying to finish reading a chapter before the end of your commute then you might as well throw that book at someone’s face.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/12/11/why-japanese-companies-cannot-expand-hint-recruitment-system/">Why Japanese Companies Cannot Expand (Hint: Recruitment System)</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Japan’s economy over the past 23 years can be described with words like “shrunk,” “stalled,” or “deflated.” The reason is simple, Japanese companies have an inability to target customers beyond those who speaks Japanese. While there are many growing opportunities in the world, Japanese companies continue to fail in grabbing those opportunities. So how can these companies expand beyond their borders? First they need to start recruiting educated foreign employees who can speak multiple languages and understand foreign cultures. However, the current recruiting system is so structured that it is nearly impossible for foreign citizens living inside or outside Japan to participate in.</p>

  <p>
    <p>One of my close friend recently started a two week internship in Osaka. Her day to day responsibilities? Clean desks and make coffee. Hardly productive and educational for students. However she was one of the lucky ones, why? Because most Japanese companies do not know what an internship is, and if they do have an internship program, it is for two to three days.</p>
