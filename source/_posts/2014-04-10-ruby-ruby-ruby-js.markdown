In mid February, I took on a project to develop a web portal for the company I was interning at, Asterism Healthcare Plus. This would be my first work on a real project rather than tutorial projects, I did warn them of course, but due to budget constraint they let me work on it. I was paired up with another guy, Laurent Safa, who wasn’t part of Asterism, but was paid to consult and manage the database for Asterism. Unlike me, Laurent was well experienced in web development, and being paired up with him meant that I would learn a ton.

Indeed, a month and a half later, I have finished my internship with a nice looking web portal to show. The portal has an Admin and Employees only page where they can view information on customers and products. Customers can also log into the portal to view their product’s current status as well as post comments on any issues. During this development, I honed my ruby skills, and now I am quite comfortable with ruby and not just rails. I started to use some jQuery and JavaScript as well for this project, I am still not quite an expert on that, but I am now making JavaScript my new priority to learn.  

What’s my plan now? There are three things:

* -Learn JavaScript over the next couple of weeks

* -Migrate this website from a WordPress site on Godaddy to a rails site possibly on Digital Ocean.

* -Graduate from the MBA program over the next few months and land a job in a tech company in the bay area.
