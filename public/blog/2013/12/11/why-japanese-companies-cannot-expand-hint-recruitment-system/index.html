        <p>Japan’s economy over the past 23 years can be described with words like “shrunk,” “stalled,” or “deflated.” The reason is simple, Japanese companies have an inability to target customers beyond those who speaks Japanese. While there are many growing opportunities in the world, Japanese companies continue to fail in grabbing those opportunities. So how can these companies expand beyond their borders? First they need to start recruiting educated foreign employees who can speak multiple languages and understand foreign cultures. However, the current recruiting system is so structured that it is nearly impossible for foreign citizens living inside or outside Japan to participate in.</p>

<p>Job hunting in Japan, known as shushoku katsudo (就職活動), formally starts December 1st of each year for students who are within two years of graduating university. However, students have already begun going to company hosted seminars and even taking an intelligence test (required by many companies) well before the formal start date. On December 1st, all Japanese companies starts hosting interviews, sometimes in groups or individually, over the course of several months. Candidates are expected to go through multiple rounds from five to as much as a dozen interviews (yes for one company). As candidates pass each round, they go up to be interviewed by a higher authority, and many times even interviewed by the CEO or members of the board of directors (yes, for entry level positions). So you can imagine the numbers of interviews and preparations a third year university student has to go through as she or he applies for multiple companies. During this period, most students skip their studies and classes, as they go through almost daily interviews.</p>

<p>If you are a foreigner and do not speak perfect Japanese, it would be double difficult to comprehend the system and land a job. If you live outside of Japan, well most likely you will miss the entire recruiting process. The system has so many barriers for a foreigner to enter.</p>

<p>Yet at this dire time in the Japanese economy, foreign employees are just what they need. The population of Japan is shrinking at an alarming rate, and Japan needs educated foreign workers to replace unoccupied positions, and help expand beyond their domestic borders.</p>

<p>Japanese companies need to start implementing a foreigner friendly recruiting system. One possible method is an internship program for foreign students. A second method is to start recruiting mid-career foreigners who have a high degree of knowledge in specific fields. However many Japanese companies don’t even recruit other mid-career Japanese, so it’s difficult to see them start now. Though, some companies are slowly changing to these new ideas, it will be at least another decade before real change can be seen.</p>
