One thing that I really miss about home is the ability to stand next to a stranger and say “Hi, how are you?” and start a conversation. You cannot find that here in Japan. Standing next to a stranger in Japan and saying “Genki desuka?” (equivalent of how are you) is just socially awkward. Of course it’s not all that bad, sometimes it’s really nice to commute on the train or bus in absolute silence. Imagine a packed train in Osaka with everyone speaking at once. if you are part of the conversation than that would be fun, but if you are trying to finish reading a chapter before the end of your commute then you might as well throw that book at someone’s face.

I’m not quite sure where I stand on this matter. Truthfully I miss random conversations, but occasionally when I see people talking loudly on the train, I glare at them and beam a “shut up I’m trying to read, don’t you know its against social norms to be having fun on the train!?” Nonetheless, 99% of the commuters just sit quietly reading a book or playing games on their smart phones.

Since the social norm in Japan is to not speak to strangers in public, strange situations happen when suddenly two strangers bump into each other. For example, many times people bump into me, and sometimes pretty hard at the train station. Rarely do they say “sumimasen” (sorry/excuse me). It’s not because they are being rude, but because social norms dictate that they shouldn’t speak. Of course sometimes my American side comes in and I just want to yell out “SAY SORRY TO ME!”

It’s also interesting to see people trying to communicate with strangers on the train without actually speaking. For example, a person sitting down may try to make himself/herself smaller by scooting closer to the side in an effort to send a “you can sit next to me” signal to a nearby standing person. There is no verbal communication between both sides, and it’s up to the standing person to notice the invitation, and whether he or she accepts to sit down. Oh and there is absolutely no eye contact, usually both are just staring down at the ground.
