In the past few months, I have:

- finished all of my MBA requirements at Kwansei Gakuin University
- left Japan and return to Reno, Nevada
- moved to Seattle, Washington
- completed the one month Codefellows foundations bootcamp
- been accepted for the two months Codefellows Ruby on Rails Accelerator

Phew! That's quite a life style change. As you can see, there are two types of modules in Codefellows that I have attended and will be attending; the foundations bootcamp, and the more advance Ruby on Rails Accelerator.

The foundations bootcamp was an intensive intro to CS and web development.<!-- more --> I had about a year worth of experience developing Ruby on Rails apps, and everything that was taught in class quickly made sense to me. What I really got out of it was the structure and best practices which I never knew before. In addition to that, the ability now to write pure JavaScript was a huge plus.

Starting tomorrow, I will be attending the first day of the Codefellows Ruby on Rails Accelerator. Again with this, I hope to absorb in best practices, and to obtain a deeper understanding of the magic that happens inside the Rails framework.

The whole day today, I have been preparing my computer by installing and/or updating a whole bunch of development software. Notably, Codefellows required that I had to uninstall RVM and instead install rbenv. I've never used rbenv before, so this will be a new learning experience for me.

In any case, I plan to keep updating this blog with my experiences at Codefellows.
