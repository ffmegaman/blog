<p>What a small world. A few days ago I had lunch with Arthur Matsumoto, former SVP of Panasonic America and now part of an angel group with extensive connections in Hong Kong. I intended to ask him more about the startups that he is working with. Little did I know that he is also involved with the creation of Knowledge Capital, the organization that is running the Knowledge Salon, a large co-working and incubation space in the new Grand Front Osaka complex. Which so happens that I have a membership myself and often go there.</p>

<p>According to Arthur, what he hopes to accomplish with Knowledge Capital is to create a strong connection between entrepreneurs in Osaka and Hong Kong in order to exchange knowledge and form new startups.  Startup teams are being sent through exchanges between the two locations, with Grand Front Osaka being the base here in Japan and the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park being the other in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>There are 2.5 million people who goes through Osaka every day, so naturally most would think that new ideas would constantly be shared and startups being formed. However, that is not the case. People simply do not talk to each other, and this is related to the culture. Knowledge Capital hopes to reverse this cultural issue and encourage the sharing of ideas.</p>

<p>Yet, nearly a year now since the opening of the Grant Front Osaka and the admission of members into the co-working space, people still are not talking to each other. This is a problem that Arthur admitted and I have observed when going there myself. There are lots of people going there to work, some individually, and some with their teams. However, there are no conversation between people outside of those they came with. Even the conversations to themselves are kept at a very low voice almost as if it is a library.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, at any given day in the Knowledge Salon, there are dozens of startups there working on their next big ideas. Hereâ€™s to the future of Osaka.</p>
