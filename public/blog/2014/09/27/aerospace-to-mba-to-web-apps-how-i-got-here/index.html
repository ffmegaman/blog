        <p>There is something peculiar about web app development; about how seemingly strange patterns of code that are there on the one side, and yet beautiful applications that emerge on the other side. It is this peculiarity that has driven me to ask “why”? It is this curiosity that has driven me to become who I am today, a web app developer, and each day to become a better developer than the previous. As I solve one problem, another presents itself, and again I continue the challenge.</p>

<p>I originally started life as a supply chain analyst in the aerospace industry immediately after graduating from university. The pay was good and the job was stable. However, something wasn’t quite right. The things I was doing there; analyzing data, writing reports, and delivering presentations did not resonate with me. I didn’t feel like I was making anything new.</p>

<p>Strange events happened, and I scored a scholarship to study for an MBA in Japan. It would become an amazing learning experience for two years, both culturally and professionally. While it was a unique experience to be studying there, I realized something; I was still not making anything new.</p>

<p>Coinciding with the start of the second year of my MBA, I came across an online tutorial for web app development. One week later, I had developed my first Ruby on Rails application modeled after Pinterest. Two weeks after that, I had my second app. I was infatuated with coding. During the day, I would rush through my business assignments in order to get home and code at night. Finally, I was making something.</p>

<p>Today, I live in Seattle, developing web apps while enjoying this amazing city. I recently enrolled in Code Fellows, an intensive code school, in order to boost myself towards my goal of becoming a better developer each day. The ability to make new and amazing applications with just tapping the keyboard is an amazing feeling of accomplishment that brings me joy each day.</p>
