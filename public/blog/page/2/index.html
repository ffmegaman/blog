<p>What a small world. A few days ago I had lunch with Arthur Matsumoto, former SVP of Panasonic America and now part of an angel group with extensive connections in Hong Kong. I intended to ask him more about the startups that he is working with. Little did I know that he is also involved with the creation of Knowledge Capital, the organization that is running the Knowledge Salon, a large co-working and incubation space in the new Grand Front Osaka complex. Which so happens that I have a membership myself and often go there.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/12/14/social-norm-dont-talk/">Social Norm - Don&#8217;t Talk</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>One thing that I really miss about home is the ability to stand next to a stranger and say “Hi, how are you?” and start a conversation. You cannot find that here in Japan. Standing next to a stranger in Japan and saying “Genki desuka?” (equivalent of how are you) is just socially awkward. Of course it’s not all that bad, sometimes it’s really nice to commute on the train or bus in absolute silence. Imagine a packed train in Osaka with everyone speaking at once. if you are part of the conversation than that would be fun, but if you are trying to finish reading a chapter before the end of your commute then you might as well throw that book at someone’s face.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/12/11/why-japanese-companies-cannot-expand-hint-recruitment-system/">Why Japanese Companies Cannot Expand (Hint: Recruitment System)</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Japan’s economy over the past 23 years can be described with words like “shrunk,” “stalled,” or “deflated.” The reason is simple, Japanese companies have an inability to target customers beyond those who speaks Japanese. While there are many growing opportunities in the world, Japanese companies continue to fail in grabbing those opportunities. So how can these companies expand beyond their borders? First they need to start recruiting educated foreign employees who can speak multiple languages and understand foreign cultures. However, the current recruiting system is so structured that it is nearly impossible for foreign citizens living inside or outside Japan to participate in.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/12/11/internships-in-japan-laugh/">Internships in Japan? (Laugh)</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>One of my close friend recently started a two week internship in Osaka. Her day to day responsibilities? Clean desks and make coffee. Hardly productive and educational for students. However she was one of the lucky ones, why? Because most Japanese companies do not know what an internship is, and if they do have an internship program, it is for two to three days.</p>
